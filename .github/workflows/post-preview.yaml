# This workflow will do a clean install of node dependencies, build the source
# code, and deploy a preview for all `post/*` branches.
#
# We choose **not** to run tests because this is an in-progress branch which
# may not be entirely stable. It isn't intended for production users, so there
# is no need to restrict previews to passing tests.
