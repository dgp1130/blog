# H1 Hello World!

This is a *post* which says **hello** to the world. I hope the world responds
~~positively~~, because I can't take any more rejection.

Time for a list!

* This is a bullet.
* This is another bullet.
    * This is a sub-bullet.
    * This is a really long bullet which line wraps at the edge of the screen
    once it gets that far and I'm definitely not just stalling here.

How about an ordered list?

1. This is an ordered bullet.
1. This is another ordered bullet.
    1. How about an ordered sub-bullet?

Would you like to do some math: z = x<sub>1</sub> + y<sup>2</sup>

How about some inline `code`? What do you think of
`FooModuleFactoryProducerManagerProvider`?

```typescript
export async function doSomething(input: string): string {
    console.log(`Does a thing with ${input}`);
    return input.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```
