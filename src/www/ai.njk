    <h1>AI Disclaimer</h1>

    <p>Main takeaways:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I don't use AI to generate blog posts.</li>
        <li>I sometimes use AI to <em>review</em> draft posts or refine my
            ideas.</li>
        <li>Some code your browser executes might be generated by AI, and I
            thoroughly review it before merging to ensure user security.</li>
        <li>I don't train any AI on your user data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        All the content on this blog is true, home grown human thought, put to
        post by fleshy fingers on a plastic keyboard. It exists as an outlet for
        my creativity, not a content mill sustained by whipping robots. I don't
        have nearly enough throughput on these posts for that to be the case. If
        AI could write these posts without much input from me, then it wouldn't
        be content worth publishing in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
        That said, I have taken to using AI as a supplemental tool, often asking
        it to review draft blog posts and identify counter-arguments or factual
        errors I might have missed. I am very aware of the risk of
        hallucinations and thoroughly fact-check these responses when needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        I haven't fully incorporated AI into my daily coding workflow, but
        occasionally I do ask it questions, use some autocomplete functionality,
        or have it generate a function or two. This means some code executing in
        your browser right now might be AI generated. Since this blog is
        built as a fully static site, you're also running the output of build
        tools partially written by AI. However, this is not a "vibe coded"
        website and I thoroughly review any content generated by AI for
        security, privacy, correctness, and just to make sure I fully follow
        what it's doing. I don't merge code I don't understand, period. Frankly,
        most of the code it generates gets rewritten by me anyways just to
        conform to my personal <span class="strikethrough">OCD tendencies</span>
        style-guide, so there's definitely a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" target="_blank">"ship of theseus"</a>
        question around whether or not its even AI generated anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don't collect any user data for purposes of training AI. As stated in
        the <a href="/privacy/">privacy policy</a>, this site does not collect
        any data which would be useful for such a purpose in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the future, I may incorporate more AI tools into my workflow, but I
        see this an implementation detail of my process. The same way a
        photographer might use the healing brush in Photoshop. I see AI as a
        tool to produce the quality content I <em>want</em> to produce, not a
        shortcut to producing lower-quality output at much higher volume. "AI
        !== AI slop", and I strive everyday to ensure AI contributions to my
        workflow <em>improve</em> the quality of my work rather than diminish
        it.
